	 * @brief This class takes any reader and generates a special type of video file, built with
	 * chunks of small video and audio data.
	 *
	 * These chunks can easily be passed around in a distributed
	 * computing environment, without needing to share the entire video file. They also allow a
	 * chunk to be frame accurate, since seeking inaccuracies are removed.
	 *
	 * \code
	 * // This example demonstrates how to feed a reader into a ChunkWriter
	 * FFmpegReader *r = new FFmpegReader("MyAwesomeVideo.mp4"); // Get a reader
	 *
	 * // Create a ChunkWriter (and a folder location on your computer)
	 * ChunkWriter w("/folder_path_to_hold_chunks/", r);
	 *
	 * // Write a block of frames to the ChunkWriter (from frame 1 to the end)
	 * w.WriteFrame(r, 1, r->info.video_length);
	 *
	 * // Close the ChunkWriter
	 * w.Close();
